### :memo: Summary

> - Summary for variables. Non constant variables can be declared and then assigned, also even changed with other values and convert from one type to another. Because JS is dynamic programming language. Variables also, can be declared and assigned at the same line. Constant variables should be declared and forced to assign a value to it, or JS will throw an error that points const variables should be assigned in declaration.
