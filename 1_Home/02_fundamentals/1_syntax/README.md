## Syntax

> Summary. JS syntax is pretty ugly, but it is useful in web development and especially in client side.

```js

// Whitespaces
let formatted = true;

if (formatted) {
    console.log("The code is easy to read");
}

// Statements
let message = "Welcome to JavaScript";
console.log(message);

// Comments

// this is single-line comment

/* this is 
    block comment */

```
