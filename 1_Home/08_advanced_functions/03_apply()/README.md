# apply() method

> __Summary__: in this doc page, you'll learn about the JS `apply()` method of the `Function` type and how to use it effectively.

## Introduction to the JavaScript apply() method

The `Function.prototype.apply()` method allows you to call a function given `this` value and arguments provided as an array. Here is the syntax of the `apply()` method:

```
fn.apply(thisArg, [args]);
```

The `apply()` method accepts two arguments:

- The `thisArg` is the value of this provided for the call to the function `fn`.
- The `args` argument is an array that specifies the arguments of the function `fn`. Since the ES5, the `args` argument can be an array-like object or array object.

The `apply()` method is similar to the `call()` method except that it takes the arguments of the function as an array instead of the individual arguments.

## JavaScript apply() method examples

Let's take a look to some of the examples using `apply()` method.

## 1. Simple JS apply() method example

Suppose that you have a `person` object:

```js
const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
};
```

...and a function named `greet()` as follows:

```js
function greet(greeting, message) {
    return `${greeting} ${this.firstName}. ${message}.`;
}
```

The greet() function accepts two parameters: greeting and message. Inside the greet() function, we reference an object that has the firstName property.

The following example shows how to use the apply() method to call the greet() function with the this set to the person object:

```js
let result = greet.apply(person, ["Hi", "I have question for you, where is your laptop, I thought that you would like to give me some data from it."]);
```

Output:

```
Hi John. I have question for you, where is your laptop, I thought that you would like to give me some data from it.
```

In this example, we set the this value inside the function to the person object. The arguments of the greet() function was passed into the apply() method as an array.

The apply() method invoked the greet() function with the this value set to the person object and arguments as an array ['Hello', 'How are you?'].

If you use the call() method, you need to pass the arguments of the greet() function separately as follows:

```js
let result = greet.apply(person, ["Hi", "I have question for you, where is your laptop, I thought that you would like to give me some data from it."]);
```

## Function borrowing

The apply() method allows an object to borrow the method of another object without duplicating the code.

Suppose that you have the following computer object:

```js
const computer = {
    name: "MacBook",
    isOn: false,
    turnOn() {
        this.isOn = true;
        return `The ${this.name} is on`;
    },
    turnOff() {
        this.isOn = false;
        return `The ${this.name} is off`;
    },
};
```

... and the following `server` object:

```js
const server = {
    name: "Dell PowerEdge T30",
    isOn: false,
};
```

The server object doesnâ€™t have the turnOn() and turnOff() methods.

To execute the turnOn() method of the computer object on the server object, you can use the apply() method as follows:

```js
let result = computer.turnOn.apply(server);

console.log(result);
```

Output:

```
The Dell PowerEdge T30 is On
```

In this example, the server object borrows the turnOn() method of the computer object.

Similarly, you can call the turnOff() method of the computer object on the server object:

```js
let result = computer.turnOff.apply(server);
console.log(result);
```

Output:

```
The Dell PowerEdge T30 is Off
```

## Using the apply() method to apped an array to another

The `apply()` method allows you to append elements of an array to another:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let numbers = [4, 5, 6];

arr.push(arr, numbers);

console.log(arr);
```

In this example, the apply() method modifies the original array arr. Note that the Array.prototype.concat() method also provides the same result except that it returns the new array instead of modifying the original array.

# :memo: Summary

- The `apply()` method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.
- The `apply()` method is similar to the `call()` method excepts that it accepts the arguments of the function as an array instead of individual arguments.
