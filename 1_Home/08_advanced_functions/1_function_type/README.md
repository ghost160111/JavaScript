# Function Type

Function is the type of doing something in order. For example, you need to get data from user about first and last names and also about the age of the user, so you create a function that gets data from user and function that sets user data to the data base. Or regarding to the UI elements, for instance, you need to create hamburget functionality in your web, you create function or functions that opens the menu list in mobile view and closes it as well. So, all in all, the function is the tool that has a certain algorithmic way of solving some kinda task, that takes some parameters and returns something throw the algorithm you create in the body of your function. Functions can have a return type and cannot have. For instance, if you want to specifically return something, adding two numbers, you should return the result of this addition right. Also there would be the cases where you do not return something, rather you do some task for other purposes or just combine functions to solve some tasks.
