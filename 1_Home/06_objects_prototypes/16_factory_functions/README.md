# Factory Functions 

## Introduction to Factory functions in JavaScript

A factory function is a function that returns a new object. The following creates a person object named `person1`:

```js
let person1 = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Marston",
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    },
};

console.log(person1.getFullName());
```

Output:

```
John Marston
```

The person1 object has two properties: firstName and lastName, and one method getFullName() that returns the full name.

Suppose that you need to create another similar object called person2, you can duplicate the code as follows:

```js
let person2 = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Marston",
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    },
};

console.log(person2.getFullName());
```

In this example, the person1 and person2 objects have the same properties and methods.

The problem is that the more objects you want to create, the more duplicate code you have.

To avoid copying the same code all over again, you can define a function that creates the person object:

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName) {
    return {
        firstName: firstName,
        lastName: lastName,
        getFullName() {
            return firstName + " " + lastName;
        },
    };
}
```

When a function creates and returns a new object, it is called a factory function. The createPerson() is a factory function because it returns a new person object.

The following show how to use the createPerson() factory function to create two objects person1 and person2:

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName) {
    return {
        firstName: firstName,
        lastName: lastName,
        getFullName() {
            return firstName + " " + lastName;
        },
    };
}

const p1 = createPerson("John", "Marston");
const p2 = createPerson("Arthur", "Morgah");

console.log(p1.getFullName()); // John Marston
console.log(p2.getFullName()); // Arthur Morgah
```

By using the factory function, you create any number of the person objects without duplicating code.

When you create an object, the JavaScript engine allocates memory to it. If you create many person objects, the JavaScript engine needs lots of memory spaces to store these objects.

However, each person object has a copy of the same getFullName() method. Itâ€™s not efficient memory management.

To avoid duplicating the same getFullName() function in every object, you can remove the getFullName() method from the person object:

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName) {
    return {
        firstName: firstName,
        lastName: lastName
    };
}
```

And move this method to another object:

```js
var personActions = {
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    },
};
```

And before calling the getFullName() method on the person object, you can assign the method of the personActions object to the person object as follows:

```js
let person1 = createPerson("John", "Marston");
let person2 = createPerson("Arthur", "Morgah");

person1.getFullName = personActions.getFullName;
person2.getFullName = personActions.getFullName;

console.log(person1.getFullName());
console.log(person2.getFullName());
```

This approach is not scalable if the object has many methods because you have to manually assign them individually. This is why the Object.create() method comes into play.

## The Object.create() method

The `Object.create()` method creates a new object using an existing obejct as the prototype of the new object:

```js
Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])
```

So you can use the `Object.create()` as follows:

```js
var personActions = {
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    },
};

function createPerson() {
    let person = Object.create(personActions);
    person.firstName = firstName;
    person.lastName = lastName;
    return person;
}
```

Now, you can create `person` objects and call the methods of the `personActions`

```js
let person1 = createPerson('John', 'Doe');
let person2 = createPerson('Jane', 'Doe');

console.log(person1.getFullName());
console.log(person2.getFullName());
```

# :memo: Summary

- A factory function is a function that returns a new object.
- Use `Object.create()` to create an object using an existing object as a prototype.
