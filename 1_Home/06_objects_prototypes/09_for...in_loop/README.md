# For...in loop

## Introduction to JavaScript for...in loop

The `for...in` loop over the enumerable properties that are keyed by strings of an object. Note that a property can be keyed by a string or a symbol.

A property is enumerable when its internal `enumerable` flag is set to `true`.

The `enumerable` flag defaults to `true` when a property is created via a simple assignment or via a property initializer:

```
object.property = value;
```

or

```js
let obj = {
    propertyName: value,
    ...
};
```

The following shows the syntax of the `for...in` loop:

```js
for (const propertyName in object) {
    // ...
}
```

The `for...in` allows you to access each property and value of an object without knowing specific name of the property. For example:

```js
var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Marston",
    ssn: "299-24-2351",
};

for (var prop in person) {
    console.log(prop + ":" + person[prop]);
}
```

In this example, we used the `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the person object. We accessed the value of each property using the following syntax:

```
object[property];
```

## The for...in loop & Inheritance

When you loop over the properties of an object that inherits from another object, the for...in statement goes up in the prototype chain and enumerates over inherited properties. Consider the following example:

```js
var decoration = {
    color: 'red'
};

var circle = Object.create(decoration);
circle.radius = 10;


for(const prop in circle) {
    console.log(prop);
}
```

Output:

```
radius
color
```

The circle object has its own prototype that references the decoration object. Therefore, the for...in loop displays the properties of the circle object and its prototype.

If you want to enumerate only the own properties of an object, you use the hasOwnProperty() method:

```js
for (const prop in circle) {
    if (circle.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
        console.log(prop);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
radius
```

## The for...in loop and Array

Itâ€™s good practice to not use the for...in to iterate over an array, especially when the order of the array elements is important.

The following example works flawlessly:

```js
const items = [10, 20, 30];
let total = 0;

for (const item in items) {
    total += items[item];
}
console.log(total);
```

However, someone may set a property of the built-in `Array` type in their libraries as follows:

```js
Array.prototype.foo = 100;
```

Hence, the `for...in` will not work correctly. For example:

```js
// someone else
Array.prototype.foo = 100;

const items = [10, 20, 30];
let total = 0;

for (let prop in items) {
    console.log({ prop, value: items[prop] });
    total += items[prop];
}
console.log(total);
```

Output:

```
{ prop: '0', value: 10 }
{ prop: '1', value: 20 }
{ prop: '2', value: 30 }
{ prop: 'foo', value: 100 }
```

Or another example:

```js
let arr = [];
// set the third element to 3, other elements are 'undefined'
arr[2] = 3;

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

The output shows three elements of the array, which is correct

```
undefined
undefined
3
```

However, the `for...in` loop ignores the first two elements:

```js
for (const key in arr) {
    console.log(arr[key]);
}
```

Output:

```
3
```

The output shows only the third element, not the first two elements.

# :memo: Summary

- The for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object. It also goes up to the prototype chain and enumerates inherited properties.
- Avoid using for...in loop to iterate over elements of an array, especially when the index order is important.
