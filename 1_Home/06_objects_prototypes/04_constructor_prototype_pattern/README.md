# Constructor prototype pattern

> Summary: in this documentation page, you'll learn how to use the JS constuctor/Prototype pattern to define a custom type in ES5

## Introduction to the JS Constructor / Prototype pattern

The combination of the constructor and prototype patterns is the most common way to define custome types in ES5. In this pattern:

- The constructor pattern defines the object properties.
- The prototype pattern defines the object methods.
