# Object literal syntax extension

> Summary: in this tutorial, you will learn about the syntax extensions of the object literal in ES6 that make your code cleaner and more flexible.

The object literal is one of the most popular patterns for creating objects in JavaScript because of its simplicity. ES6 makes the object literal more succinct and powerful by extending the syntax in some ways.

## Object property initializer shorthand

Prior to ES6, an object literal is a collection of name-value pairs. For example:

```js
function createMachine(name, status) {
    return {
        name: name,
        status: status,
    };
}
```

The createMachine() function takes two arguments name and status and returns a new object literal with two properties: name and status.

The name and status properties take the values of the name and status parameters. This syntax looks redundant because name and status mentioned twice in both the name and value of properties.

ES6 allows you to eliminate the duplication when a property of an object is the same as the local variable name by including the name without a colon and value.

For example, you can rewrite the createMachine() function in ES6 as follows:

```js
function createMachine(name, status) {
    return {
        name,
        status,
    };
}
```

Internally, when a property of an object literal only has a name, the JavaScript engine searches for a variable with the same name in the surrounding scope. If the JavaScript engine can find one, it assigns the property the value of the variable.

In this example, the JavaScript engine assigns the name and status property values of the name and status arguments.

Similarly, you can construct an object literal from local variables as shown in the following example:

```js
let name = "Computer",
    status = "On";
```

## Computed property name

Prior to ES6, you could use the square brackets( [])  to enable the computed property names for the properties on objects.

The square brackets allow you to use the string literals and variables as the property names.

See the following example:

```js
let name = "machine name";
let machine = {
    [name]: "server",
    "machine hours": 10000,
};
```

he name variable was initialized to a value of 'machine name'. Since both properties of the machine object contains a space, you can only reference them using the square brackets.

In ES6, the computed property name is a part of the object literal syntax, and it uses the square bracket notation.

When a property name is placed inside the square brackets, the JavaScript engine evaluates it as a string. It means that you can use an expression as a property name. For example:

```js
let prefix = "machine";
let machine = {
    [prefix + " name"]: "server",
    [prefix + " hours"]: 10000,
};

console.log(machine["machine name"]); // server
console.log(machine["machine hours"]); // 10000
```

The machine objectâ€™s properties evaluate to 'machine name' and 'machine hours', therefore you can reference them as the properties of the machine object.

## Concise method syntax

Prior to ES6, when defining a method for an object literal, you need to specify the name and full function definition as shown in the following example:

```js
let server = {
    name: "Server",
    restart: function() {
        console.log("The " + this.name + " is restarting...");
    },
};
```

ES6 makes syntax for making method of the object literal more succinct by removing the colon(`:`) and the `function` keyword.

The following example rewrites the `server` object above using the ES6 syntax:

```js
let server = {
    name: "Server",
    restart() {
        console.log("The " + this.nmae + " is restarting...");
    },
};
```

This shorthand syntax is also known as the __concise method syntax__. It's valid to have spaces in the property name. For example:

```js
let server = {
    name: "Server",
    restart() {
        console.log("The " + this.name + " is restarting...");
    },
    "starting up"() {
        console.log("The " + this.name + " is starting up...");
    },
};

server["starting up"]();
```

In this example, the method `"starting up"` has the spaces in its name. To call the method, you use the following syntax:

```js
object_name["property name"]();
```
