## Introduction

> This is the introduction section, here you will learn basics of JS, it does not cover a lot of topics

```js
"use strict";
```

> Basically "use strict" means that the strict mode is enabled below this line of code, above will not work, and it will show every error and follow correct and preferable syntax.
