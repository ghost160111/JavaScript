# Generators

> __Summary__: in this doc page, you'll learn about JS Generators and how to use them effectively.

## Introduction to JS Generators

In JS, a regular function is executed based on the run-to-completion model. It cannot pause midway and then continues from where it paused. For example:

```js
function foo() {
    console.log("I");
    console.log("cannot");
    console.log("pause");
}
```

The foo() function executes from top to bottom. The only way to exit the foo() is by returning from it or throwing an error. If you invoke the foo() function again, it will start the execution from the top to bottom.

```js
foo();
```

Output:

```
I
cannot
pause
```

ES6 introduces a new kind of function that is different from a regular function: function generator or generator.

A generator can pause midway and then continues from where it paused. For example:

```js
function* generate() {
    console.log("invoked 1st time");
    yield 1;
    console.log("invoked 2nd time");
    yield 2;
}
```

Let's examine the `generate()` function in detail.

- First, you see is the asterisk (`*`) after the function keyword. The asterisk denotes that the `generate()` is generator, not a normal function.
- Second, the `yield` statement returns a value and pauses the execution of the function.

The following code invokes the `generate()` generator:

```js
let gen = generate();
```

When you invoke the `generate()` generator:

- First, you see nothing in the console. If the generate() were a regular function, you would expect to see some messages.
- Second, you get something back from generate() as a returned value.

Letâ€™s show the returned value on the console:

```js
console.log(gen);
```

Output:

```
Object [Generator] {}
```

So, a generator returns a Generator object without executing its body when it is invoked.

The Generator object returns another object with two properties: done and value. In other words, a Generator object is iterable.

The following calls the next() method on the Generator object:

```js
let result = gen.next();
console.log(result);
```

Output:

```
invoked 1st time
{ value: 1, done: false }
```

As you can see, the Generator object executes its body which outputs message 'invoked 1st time' at line 1 and returns the value 1 at line 2.

The yield statement returns 1 and pauses the generator at line 2.

Similarly, the following code invokes the next() method of the Generator second time:

```js
result = gen.next();
console.log(result);
```

Output:

```
invoked 2nd time
{ value: 2, done: false }
```

This time the Generator resumes its execution from line 3 that outputs the message 'invoked 2nd time' and returns (or yield) 2.

The following invokes the next() method of the generator object a third time:

```js
result = gen.next();
console.log(result);
```

Output:

```
{ value: undefined, done: true }
```

Since generator is iterable, you can use the for..of loop:

```js
for (const g of gen) {
    console.log(g);
}
```

Here is the output:

```
invoked 1st time
1
invoked 2nd time
2
```

## More JS generator examples

The following example illustrates how to use a generator to generate a never-ending sequence:

```js
function* forever() {
    let index = 0;
    while(true) {
        yield index++;
    }
}

let f = forever();

console.log(f.next()); // 0
console.log(f.next()); // 1
console.log(f.next()); // 2
```

Each time you call the next() method of the forever generator, it returns the next number in the sequence starting from 0.

## Using generators to implement iterators

When you implement an iterator, you have to manually define the next() method. In the next() method, you also have to manually save the state of the current element.

Since generators are iterables, they can help you simplify the code for implementing iterator.

The following is a Sequence iterator created in the iterator doc page:

```js
class Sequence {
    #start;
    #end;
    #interval;
    constructor(start = 0, end = Infinity, interval = 1) {
        this.#start = start;
        this.#end = end;
        this.#interval = interval;
    }
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
        let counter = 0;
        let nextIndex = this.#start;
        return {
            next: () => {
                if (nextIndex < this.#end) {
                    let result = { value: nextIndex, done: false };
                    nextIndex += this.#interval;
                    counter++;
                    return result;
                }
                return { value: counter, done: true };
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And here is the new Sequence iterator that uses a generator:

```js
class Sequence {
    #start;
    #end;
    #interval;
    constructor(start = 0, end = Infinity, interval = 1) {
        this.#start = start;
        this.#end = end;
        this.#interaval = interval;
    }
    * [Symbol.iterator]() {
        for (let index = this.#start; index <= this.#end, index += this.#interval) {
            yield index;
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, the method Symbol.iterator is much simpler by using the generator.

The following script uses the Sequence iterator to generate a sequence of odd numbers from 1 to 10:

```js
let oddNumbers = new Sequence(1, 10, 2);

for (const num of oddNumbers) {
    console.log(num);
}
```

Output:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

## Using a generator to implement the Bag data structure

A Bag is data structure that has the ability to collect elements and iterate through elements. It doesn't support removing items.

The following script implements the Bag data structure:

```js
class Bag {
    #elements;
    constructor() {
        this.#elements = [];
    }
    isEmpty() {
        return this.#elements.length === 0;
    }
    add(element) {
        this.#elements.push(element);
    }
    * [Symbol.iterator]() {
        for (const element of this.#element) {
            yield element;
        }
    }
}

let bag = new Bag();

bag.add(1);
bag.add(2);
bag.add(3);

for (const e of bag) {
    console.log(e);
}
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

# :memo: Summary

- Generators are created by the generator function function* f(){}.
- Generators do not execute its body immediately when they are invoked.
- Generators can pause midway and resumes their executions where they were paused. The yield statement pauses the execution of a generator and returns a value.
- Generators are iterable so you can use them with the for...of loop.
