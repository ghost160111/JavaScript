# Async Generators

> __Summary__: in this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about the JavaScript async generators that iterate over data which comes asynchronously.

## What is an async generator

An async generator is similar to a regular generator except that its next() method returns a Promise. To iterate over an async generator, you use the for await...of statement.

## Introduction to the JavaScript async generators

A regular generator is a function that can pause midway and continues from where it paused. See the following example:

```js
function* sequence(start, end) {
    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        yield i;
    }
}

let seq = sequence(1, 5);

for (const num of seq) {
    console.log(num);
}
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

The sequence is a generator that returns a number from the start to the end.

An async generator is similar to a regular generator with the following differences:

- The async keyword is placed in front of the function keyword.
- The yield returns a Promise , instead of a value. The Promise is typically a wrapper of an asynchronous operation.

The following illustrates how to convert the generator sequence to the async generator asyncSequence:

```js
async function* asyncSequence(start, end) {
    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve(i);
            }, 1000);
        });
    }
}
```

Note that we used the setTimeout() to simulate an asynchronous operation.

To iterate over the entire async generator, you use the for await...of statement.

Since we only can use the await keyword inside an async function, we wrap the code inside an async IIFE as follows:

```js
(async () => {
    let seq = asyncSequence(1, 5);

    for await (const num of seq) {
        console.log(num);
    }
})();
```

The code returns a sequence from 1 to 5 after every second:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

The async generators can be very useful when you access a stream of data and want to report the progress like using a progress bar
