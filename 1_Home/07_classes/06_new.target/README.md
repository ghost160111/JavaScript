# Introduction to JavaScript new.target Metaproperty

> __Summary__: in this doc page, you will learn about the JavaScript `new.target` metaproperty that detects whether a function or constructor was called using the `new` operator.

## Introduction to JavaScript new.target

ES6 provides a metaproperty named `new.target` that allows you to detect whether a function or constructor was called using the `new` operator.

The `new.target` consists of the `new` keyword, a dot, and `target` property. The `new.target` is available in all functions.

However, in arrow functions, the `new.target` is the one that belongs to the surrounding function.

The `new.target` is very useful to inspect at runtime whether a function is being executed as a function or as a constructor. It is also handy to determine a specific derived class that was called by using the `new` operator from within a parent class.

## JavaScript new.target in functions

Let's see the following `Person` constructor function:

```js
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
```

You can create a new object from the `Person` function by using the `new` operator as follows:

```js
let john = new Person("John");
console.log(john.name); // John
```

Or you can call the `Person` as a function:

```js
Person("Marston");
```

Because the this is set to the global object i.e., the window object when you run JavaScript in the web browser, the name property is added to the window object as follows:

```js
console.log(window.name); // Marston
```

To help you detect whether a function was called using the new operator, you use the `new.target` metaproperty.

In a regular function call, the new.target returns undefined. If the function was called with the new operator, the new.target returns a reference to the function.

Suppose you donâ€™t want the Person to be called as a function, you can use the new.target as follows:

```js
function Person(name) {
    if (!new.target) {
        throw "must use new operator with Person";
    }
    this.name = name;
}
```

Now, the only way to use `Person` is to instantiate an object from it by using the `new` operator. If you try to call it as a regular function, you will get an error.

## JS new.target in constructors

In a class constructor, the `new.target` refers to the constructor that was invoked directly by the `new` operator. It is `true` if the constructor is in the parent class and was delegated from the constructor of the child class:

```js
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        console.log(new.target.name);
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    constructor(name, title) {
        super(name);
        this.title = title;
    }
}

let john = new Person("John Marston"); // Person
let arthur = new Employee("Arthur Morgah"); // Employee
```

In this example, `new.target.name` is the human-friendly name of the constructor reference of `new.target`

In this doc page, you have learned how to use the JS `new.target` metaproperty to detect whether a function or constructor was called using the `new` operator.
