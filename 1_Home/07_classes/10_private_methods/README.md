# Private Methods

> __Summary__: in this doc page, you'll learn about JS private methods including private instance methods, private static methods, and private getter/setter.

## Introduction to JS private methods

By default, members of a class are public. ES2020 introduced the private members that include private fields and methods.

To make a public method private, you prefix its name with a hash `#`. JS allows you to define private methods for instance methods, static methods, and getter/setters.

The following shows the syntax of defining a private instance method:

```js
class MyClass {
    #privateMethod() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this syntax, the `#privateMethod()` is a private instance method. It can only be called inside the `MyClass`. In other words, it cannot be called from outside the class or in the subclasses of the `MyClass`.

To call the `#privateMethod` inside the `MyClass`, you use the `this` keyword as follows:

```js
this.#privateMethod();
```

The following illustrates the syntax of defining a private static method:

```js
class MyClass {
    static #privateStaticMethod() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

To call the `#privateStaticMethod()` inside the `MyClass`, you use the class name instead of the `this` keyword:

```js
MyClass.#privateStaticMethod();
```

The following shows the syntax of the private getters/setters:

```js
class MyClass {
    #field;

    get #myField() {
        return #field;
    }

    set #myField(value) {
        #field = value;
    }
}
```

In this example, the #myField is the private getter and setter that provide access to the private field #field.

In practice, you use private methods to minimize the number of methods that the object exposes.

As a rule of thumb, you should make all class methods private by default first. And then you make a method public whenever the object needs to use that method to interact with other objects.

## JavaScript private method examples

Letâ€™s take some examples of using private methods

### 1) Private instance method example

The following illustrates how to define the Person class with private instance methods:

```js
class Person {
    #firstName;
    #lastName;
    
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.#firstName = firstName;
        this.#lastName = lastName;
    }

    getFullName(format = true) {
        return format ? this.#firstLast() : this.#lastFirst();
    }

    #firstLast() {
        return `${this.#firstName} ${this.#lastName}`;
    }

    #lastFirst() {
        return `${this.#lastFirst}, ${this.#firstName}`;
    }
}

let person = new Person("John", "Marston");
console.log(person.getFullName(false)); // Marston John
```

Output:

```
John Marston
```

In this example:

- First, define two private fields `#firstName` and `#lastName` in the `Person` class body.

- Second, define the private methods `#firstLast()` and `#lastFirst()`. These methods return the full name in different formats.

- Third, define the public instance method `getFullName()` that returns a person's full name. The `getFullName()` method calls the private method `#firstLast()` and `#lastFirst()` to return the full name.

- Finally, create a new `Person` object and output the full name to the console.

### 2) Private static method example

The following adds the `#validate()` private static method to the `Person` class:

```js
class Person {
    #firstName;
    #lastName;

    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.#firstName = Person.#validate(firstName);
        this.#lastName = Person.#validate(lastName);
    }

    getFullName(format = true) {
        return format ? this.#firstLast() : this.#lastFirst();
    }

    static #validate(name) {
        if (typeof name === "string") {
            let str = name.trim();
            if (str.length >= 3) {
                return str;
            }
        }
        throw "The name must be a string with at least 3 characters";
    }

    #firstLast() {
        return `${this.#firstName} ${this.#lastName}`;
    }

    #lastFirst() {
        return `${this.#lastName} ${this.#firstName}`;
    }
}

let person = new Person("John", "Marston");
console.log(person.getFullName());
```

How it works.

First, define the static method #validate() that returns a value if it is a string with at least three characters. The method raises an exception otherwise.

Second, call the #validate() private static method in the constructor to validate the firstName and lastName arguments before assigning them to the corresponding private attributes.

# :memo: Summary

- Prefix a method name with the # to make it private.
- Private methods can be called inside the class, not from outside of the class or in the subclasses.
