# For Loop

## Introduction to the JS for loop statement

The ```for``` loop statement creates a loop with three optional expressions. The following illustrates the syntax of the ```for``` loop statement:

```js
for (initializer; condition; iterator) {
    // statements
}
```

## 1. Iterator

The for statement executes the initializer only once the loop starts. Typically, you declare and initialize a local loop variable in the initializer.

## 2. Condition

The condition is a boolean expression that determines whether the for should execute the next iteration.

The for statement evaluates the condition before each iteration. If the condition is true (or is not present), it executes the next iteration. Otherwise, itâ€™ll end the loop.


## 3. Iterator

The for statement executes the iterator after each iteration.

The following flowchart illustrates the for loop:

In the for loop, the three expressions are optional. The following shows the for loop without any expressions:

```js
for ( ; ; ) {
    // statements
}
```

## JavaScript for loop examples

Let's take some examples of using the ```for``` loop statement.

## 1. A simple JS for example

The following example uses the ```for``` loop statement to show numbers from 1 to 4 to console:

```js
for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

Output:
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4

How it works

- First, declare variable ```counter``` and initialize it to 1.
- Second, display the value of ```counter``` in the console if ```counter``` is less than 5.
- Third, increase the value of ```counter``` by one in each iteration of the loop.

## 2. Using the JS for loop without the initializer example

The following example uses a ```for``` loop that has no initializer expression:

```js
let j = 1;
for (; j < 10; j += 2) {
    console.log(j);
}
```

Output:
- 1
- 3
- 5
- 7
- 9

## 3. Using the JS for loop without the condition example

Similar to the initializer expression, the condition expression is optional. If you omit the condition expression, you need to use a break statement to terminate the loop.

```js
for (let j = 1; ; j += 2) {
    console.log(j);
    if (j > 10) {
        break;
    }
}
```

Output:
- 1
- 3
- 5
- 7
- 9
- 11

## 3. Using the JS for loop statement without any expression example

All three expressions of the ```for``` loop statements are optional. Therefore, you can omit all of them. For example:

```js

let j = 1;
for (;;) {
    if (j > 10) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(j);
    j += 2;
}

```

Output:
- 1
- 3
- 5
- 7
- 9

## 4. Using the JS for loop without the loop body example

JS allows the ```for``` statement to have an empty statement. In this case, you place a semicolon (```;```) immediately after the ```for``` statement.

For example, the following uses a for loop calculate the sum of 10 numbres from 1 to 10:

```js
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++, sum += i);
console.log(sum);
```

Output:
- 55

# :memo: Summary

- Use the JS ```for``` statement to create a loop that execute a block based using various options.
