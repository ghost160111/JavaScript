# If statement

## Introduction to the JS if statement

The ```if``` statement executes block if a condition is ```true```. The following shows the syntax of the ```if``` statement:

```js
if ( condition ) {
    statement;
}
```

The ```condition``` can be a value or an expression. Typically, the condition evaluates to a Boolean value, which is ```true``` or ```false```.

If the ```condition``` evaluates to ```true```, the ```if``` statement executes the ```statement```. Otherwise, the ```if``` statement passes the control to the next statement after it.

The following flowchart illustrates how the ```if``` statement works:
